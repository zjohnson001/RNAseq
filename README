# RNA Sequencing Environment
The RNAseq_env folder acts as an environment for all RNAseq processing/storage for raw reads, reference sequences, and metadata

## 3 core commands:
gen_refseqs.sh
initialize.sh
run_pipeline.sh

## gen_refseqs.sh <folder_name> <organism_name> <database_sequences_came_from>
Requires inputs
folder name: will be specified when the directory structure for a new RNAseq project is initialized
organism name: used as a prefix to call indexed .fasta files
database: where sequences came from, a date is added so that all metadata is retained improving reproducibility.

## The user must add additional reference sequences:
A gene transfer file (.gtf/.gff) is added to the _gtf_file directory
One or more .fasta files containing reference sequences the RNAseq reads will be aligned against are added to the __fasta_map_sequences directory

A directory in __metadata/ref_seqs/ is created under the folder_name
reference sequences are moved into the new directory, .fasta sequences into the subdirectory database_date_mapped_sequences
.fasta sequences are concatenated together and indexed, saving the indexed files under a subdirectory labelled by bowtie2_organism.
